#  URL Shortener with Analytics 

A full-stack URL shortener web application built using Flask and MySQL. This project allows users to convert long URLs into short, shareable links and track their usage with analytics.

---
## 🧠 Working

First, a POST request is sent using Postman containing the long URL.  
The Flask backend receives the request and stores the URL in a MySQL database, where a unique auto-increment ID is generated.  

This ID is then converted into a short code using Base62 encoding and updated in the database.  

When a user accesses the short URL, the system retrieves the corresponding original URL from the database and redirects the user to it.  
Additionally, each access is recorded to track click analytics.


## 📌 Features

* 🔗 Shorten long URLs into compact links
* 🔁 Redirect short URLs to original URLs
* 📊 Track click analytics for each URL
* 💾 Store URL mappings in MySQL database
* ⚡ Fast and efficient Base62 encoding

## 🌍 Real-World Concept

Currently, the project runs on localhost. In real-world systems like Bitly:

* Backend is hosted on cloud
* Database is remotely accessible
* URLs are publicly accessible worldwide

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* 🌐 Deploy on cloud (Render / AWS)
* 🔐 User authentication
* 📈 Advanced analytics dashboard
* ⏳ URL expiration feature
* 📱 Mobile-friendly UI
